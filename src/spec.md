# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the admin-only server status label so it shows “Online” instead of “Local Offline” wherever that specific label appears in the admin-mode server controls.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the displayed status text “Local Offline” with “Online” in the admin-mode server status/availability UI.
- Ensure only this specific label is updated and other status labels (e.g., “Checking…”, “Offline”) remain unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** In admin mode server controls, the status indicator no longer shows “Local Offline” and instead displays “Online” when that label would have been shown.
