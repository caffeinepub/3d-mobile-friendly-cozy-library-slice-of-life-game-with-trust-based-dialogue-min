  "summary": "3D mobile-friendly slice-of-life adventure/visual-novel hybrid set entirely in Puro’s library, focused on building friendship/trust through dialogue and cozy activities, featuring multiple endings including a low-friendship Betrayal ending with Special Edition variants.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Core gameplay loop centered on a hub-based, single-location library environment with repeatable daily activities and relationship progression.",
    "Ending selection logic driven primarily by Trust/Friendship thresholds (including Special Edition sub-variants for very low vs slightly low friendship).",
    "Project should include a clear startup/entrypoint file (e.g., main executable scene/script) used by build/deployment to launch the game.",
    "Startup/New Game depends on an Internet Computer canister method call (startNewGame); app should handle canister availability (stopped) with preflight/health checks and user-facing recovery messaging.",
    "Backend availability requirement: keep the Internet Computer canister running/always-online (monitoring + auto-restart/ops process) to prevent launch flows (startNewGame/continueGame) from failing due to a stopped canister.",
    "Potential scope conflict: IC canisters generally cannot be started/stopped from within the app/canister itself; any server on/off control likely must be an ops/admin-only external action (or simulated locally) rather than a true canister lifecycle toggle.",
    "User reiterates requirement for an in-app switch to set the backend/server online/offline (true on/off control), which may conflict with IC canister lifecycle limitations.",
    "User requests admin-only switches be restricted by a specific username (not by Internet Identity principal), implying some form of username capture/storage and a trust model for admin gating.",
    "Admin-mode gating username updated: unlock admin-only controls only when entered username exactly matches \"hood\"."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Art/style scope conflict: user requests a 3D game, but gameplay style mentions 2D pixel art aesthetics—needs final decision on visual style.",
    "App/game fails to start when clicking the startup/entrypoint (startup launch issue reported by user).",
    "New Game fails with IC0508 non_replicated_rejection: canister pmng3-byaaa-aaaag-awtia-cai is stopped (reject_code 5), resulting in Game Mounted: No.",
    "React runtime error: \"Maximum update depth exceeded\" indicating an infinite render/update loop (likely repeated setState in componentDidUpdate/componentWillUpdate or an effect without stable dependencies).",
    "Request conflict risk: user asked for an in-app server on/off switch, but existing requirement states the terminal must not claim to start/stop/restart the backend canister; needs clarification/decision (admin-only external control vs simulated toggle).",
    "Admin gating approach conflict: earlier plan uses Internet Identity principal; user now requests username-based gating, which may be spoofable without strong authentication—needs a decision on security model.",
    "Deployment to network failed (deployment error); user requested retry deployment."
