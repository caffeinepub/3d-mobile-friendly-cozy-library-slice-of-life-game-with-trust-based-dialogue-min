  "summary": "Core admin-gate changes appear implemented: the configured admin username is now exactly \"ADMIN\" with case-sensitive exact-match unlock, and the persisted unlock storage key is derived from the username to invalidate previously persisted unlocked state when the username changes. Some additional non-requested files were modified (summaries/state metadata).",

      "reason": "The diff shows the store/config changes, but does not show any UI components or gating logic being verified/updated to use the new condition; only a file listing summary mentions TitleScreen has conditional admin UI. With the provided diff summary alone, it’s not possible to confirm the UI still gates correctly under the new unlock condition.",
