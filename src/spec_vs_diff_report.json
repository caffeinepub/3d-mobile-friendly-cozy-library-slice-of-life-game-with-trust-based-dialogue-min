  "summary": "The diff adds a right-side touch look area in `MobileControlsOverlay.tsx` with touch tracking and uses the existing `updateLook` pipeline while respecting the paused/terminal disabled state. However, the provided (truncated) diff does not show touch-end/reset handling needed to fully satisfy REQ-2 (and part of REQ-1’s “no drift” behavior).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Reset look drag state and neutralize look delta on touch end so subsequent drags don’t jump and camera doesn’t drift.",
      "reason": "The diff shows initialization on touch start (`lookTouchRef.current = { id, lastX, lastY }`) and applying deltas on move (`updateLook(-deltaX, -deltaY)`), but does not show any `touchend`/`touchcancel` handler that clears `lookTouchRef` and sets look delta back to neutral (e.g., `updateLook(0,0)`). Because the file is truncated, this may exist below, but it is not evidenced in the provided diff.",

        "frontend/src/game/controls/MobileControlsOverlay.tsx (truncated snippet shows handleLookStart/handleLookMove but no end/reset logic)"

      "reason": "These changes are not part of the BuildRequest requirements (which focus on mobile look controls behavior) and appear to be meta/project bookkeeping rather than requested functionality.",
