  "summary": "Diff implements a visible player avatar (capsule mesh) in LibraryScene, unified movement input from keyboard + mobile joystick, basic jump request handling (Space + mobile trigger) with gravity/ground collision, and adds a mobile controls store plus overlay changes that appear to include a Jump button. Some REQ-51 acceptance criteria (exact English label text and non-interference with other touch controls) cannot be fully verified from the truncated diff snippet.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-51",
      "requirement": "On touch devices, a clearly visible button labeled \"Jump\" appears in the gameplay HUD alongside the existing mobile controls, and it must not interfere with joystick/look touch interactions.",
      "reason": "MobileControlsOverlay.tsx is truncated before the actual Jump button JSX/label and layout/positioning details. While the code references a handleJumpClick/triggerJump and imports Button, the diff excerpt does not show the rendered Button with the exact label text \"Jump\" nor enough layout/touch-handling context to confirm it won’t interfere with joystick or look controls.",

      "description": "Added a new Zustand store (usePlayerControlsStore) to hold joystick/look/jump state across controls and scene.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest did not specify adding a dedicated controls store; it only required movement/jump behavior and a mobile Jump button. This is an implementation detail not requested explicitly.",
