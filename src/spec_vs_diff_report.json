  "summary": "The diff appears to address the reported infinite update loop by adding guarded, ref-based initialization in `GameView.tsx` and by stabilizing `playBackgroundMusic` with `useCallback` in `useAudio.ts`. No clearly required items from REQ-28/29/30 are obviously missing based on the provided diff summary, but the audio changes introduce additional state/persistence behavior not explicitly requested.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Introduced a persisted Zustand audio settings store (volume/mute) as part of the audio hook, which goes beyond stabilizing function identity for playback.",
      "reason": "REQ-30 asks to stabilize effect dependencies/function identities to avoid re-running initialization; it does not request adding/persisting audio settings state.",

      "description": "Added new console logging for audio autoplay-blocked and audio init/pause warnings.",
      "reason": "Not requested by REQ-28/29/30; while not user-facing UI text, it is additional behavior beyond the specified fix.",
