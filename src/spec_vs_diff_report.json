  "summary": "REQ-25 and most of REQ-26 appear implemented: backend exposes a non-throwing `isAvailable()` query, and the frontend performs availability checks on the Title screen with polling, UI warning, disabled launch buttons, and a retry action. REQ-27 is only partially evidenced due to doc truncation; explicit guidance for funding with cycles and troubleshooting steps are not clearly present in the shown diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-27",
      "requirement": "Operations document includes explicit guidance for keeping the canister running (started, funded with cycles) and what to check when users see 'server offline/stopped' errors.",
      "reason": "The added ops doc clearly states the uptime limitation and controller responsibility, and starts a section about ensuring the canister is started, but the provided diff is truncated before any concrete steps/commands and does not show guidance about cycles funding or a troubleshooting checklist.",

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-26",
      "requirement": "Preflight check immediately before invoking both New Game and Continue.",
      "reason": "The diff shows a preflight check in `handleNewGame`, but the `handleContinue` implementation is not visible in the truncated `App.tsx` excerpt, so it cannot be confirmed from the provided evidence.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added extensive launch diagnostics tracking (startupComplete, launchStage, gameMounted, etc.) and related launch-error navigation beyond a simple availability preflight/UI warning.",
      "reason": "REQ-26 requests a preflight availability check and clear offline UI on the Title screen; the additional diagnostics state machinery is not requested in the BuildRequest.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Introduced launch error normalization utility usage (`normalizeLaunchError`) not mentioned in requirements.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest does not ask for error normalization; it only requires English UI messaging when the server is offline/stopped.",
