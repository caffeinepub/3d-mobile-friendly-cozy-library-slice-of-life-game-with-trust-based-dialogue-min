  "summary": "REQ-46 is partially implemented: a new markdown troubleshooting guide file was added and OPS docs were updated to link to it, but the added guide content is truncated in the diff so key acceptance-criteria sections cannot be verified. Additionally, unrequested backend migration/upgrade scaffolding was added and backend/main.mo was modified to use it, which is outside the documentation-only request.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-46",
      "requirement": "Provide step-by-step instructions to retry deployment after a failure, and include a section of common failure modes (build failure, identity/auth issues, canister stopped, out of cycles) with next checks; the guide must reference frontend/OPS_CANISTER_AVAILABILITY.md rather than duplicating it.",
      "reason": "Although frontend/DEPLOYMENT_TROUBLESHOOTING.md was added, the diff content for that file is truncated right after starting 'Verify Canister Status' and does not show the required retry steps, the common failure modes section, or any reference/link to frontend/OPS_CANISTER_AVAILABILITY.md from within the new guide.",

Adding backend/migration.mo and modifying backend/main.mo to import and use Migration is not requested, and the request explicitly limited backend changes to a single Motoko actor unless a state upgrade is required (not indicated in the request).",
