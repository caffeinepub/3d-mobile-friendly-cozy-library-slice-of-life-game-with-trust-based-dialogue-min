  "summary": "Diff largely aligns with always-online behavior: backend availability polling is enabled whenever the Title Screen is active, UI server status now appears derived from backend availability (Checking/Online/Offline), launch actions are gated by backend health instead of a local toggle, terminal commands include `server status` and do not reference a local offline mode, and OPS documentation adds clear uptime limitations and links to deployment troubleshooting. Some acceptance criteria cannot be fully verified due to truncation (notably: removal of the Title Screen toggle/text and whether `server status` specifically calls `actor.isAvailable()`).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-59",
      "requirement": "Diagnostic Terminal `status` / `server status` commands no longer check/report local offline mode; they attempt `actor.isAvailable()` and report Online/Offline accordingly.",
      "reason": "The diff shows terminal `server status` calling an injected `checkServerStatus()` function, but does not provide evidence that this function uses `actor.isAvailable()` specifically (it could be implemented differently).",
