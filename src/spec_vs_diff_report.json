  "summary": "The diff implements a persisted local \"server access\" toggle via a new Zustand store, integrates it into the Title Screen UI, disables backend availability polling when OFF, and adds Diagnostic Terminal commands/help text for toggling and for status behavior when access is OFF. The diff also appears to include unrelated gameplay/scene/control fixes not requested in the BuildRequest.",

      "reason": "The diff shows an explicit guard in App.tsx for New Game when serverAccessEnabled is false, but the Continue flow code is not visible in the provided truncated App.tsx excerpt. Without seeing the Continue handler/mutation invocation, it cannot be confirmed from the diff summary alone.",
